# Ecobazar

Ecobazar is a React app built with Vite that allows you to explore eco-friendly products.

## Getting Started

To run Ecobazar locally on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended LTS version)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) (Package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecobazar.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ecobazar
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

### Running the App

Now that you have the project set up, you can run Ecobazar locally:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the app in your browser at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, you can run the following command:
